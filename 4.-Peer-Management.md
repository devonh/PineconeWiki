Pinecone nodes must be able to respond to changing network conditions, with peers connecting and disconnecting at any moment. A node should do the following things when peers connect or disconnect.


### Peer connects

When a new peer connects to a node, the node should immediately send the latest root update from the chosen parent. If no chosen parent is available or the node is acting as a root, the node should send its own root update immediately.


### Peer disconnects

A Pinecone node must immediately remove any state related to a peer that disconnects, including the last received root announcement from that peer.

If the chosen parent is the disconnected peer, the node must re-run the parent selection algorithm immediately, either selecting a new parent (with the equivalent **Root public key** and **Root sequence**) or by becoming a root node and waiting for a stronger update from a peer.

If the disconnected peer appears in any entry in the routing table, as either the **Source port** or **Destination port**, the entry should be removed from the routing table.

If the disconnected port is the **Source port** of the descending node entry, the descending entry should be cleared.
